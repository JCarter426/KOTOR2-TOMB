### Explanation
Would anyone be surprised to learn that the Bastila you encounter in the Tomb of Ludo Kressh is nothing at all like the Bastila of KOTOR fame? If you answered ‘no’ that’s good, you’re learning.

Now, one could argue that she _shouldn’t_ be the same as the historical Bastila: she’s a vision conjured by the tomb, after all, rather than being the genuine flesh-and-blood article. The vision is not only an abstraction of the Exile’s own mind, colored by the prejudices and gaps in knowledge that the Exile had—in other words, her perception of what Bastila was like rather than what she was like in truth—but moreover ‘Bastila,’ like all the other visions, is implied to actually be the beasts of the cave wearing her guise during your psychedelic trip of hotboxing pure Dark Side kush (or maybe at worst a physical manifestation of the Dark Side). In other words, the vision-creatures are entities which might logically have differing strengths than the real people whom they are representing.

_However._

There’s a lot of evidence that, at a bare minimum, the Exile’s perception of these individuals plays an important role in how strongly the vision-self can impact her. For instance, Bastila and the other Jedi vision-Malak are trying to convince are shown to be Light Side, and thus take the full impact of the tomb’s DS alignment, suffering massive penalties to saving throws; this is evidence that there is a physical response in the real world to how these visions are conceived of in the Exile’s mind. Similarly, Malak is much stronger than Bastila or the other Jedi are, which tracks with the Exile’s inevitable perception of him as one of the stronger Jedi of the period: certainly more impactful than Bastila, despite her Battle Meditation.

I think this is a sufficiently persuasive case to make Bastila at least a rough cognate of how she would have been when the Exile last knew her: in other words, as a teenager before the Exile went off to fight in the Mandalorian Wars. Because Bastila is younger, I have not given her the exact same stat line as she has in the first game: due to her youth I take away 2 STR from her (rationally, she shouldn’t even be an adult at this point in time), as well as a few Force abilities and Feats. She’s also been moved to her proper Sentinel class, and given actual Force points so she can use some of her limited abilities. She also has Battle Meditation, because… well, y’know.

### Explanation

Given what I just said above, I’m sure some are scratching their heads at how little I change Malak. This is supposed to be Malak before he even left for the war, but he has lightning? He’s using a red saber?! What are you, some kind of hack??

Yes, but that aside, the internal logic of this vision is visibly twisted. Though it chronologically begins before Malak and Revan even left for the Wars, Malak later begins talking about how they craved battle, their lust for power, and eventually Bastila’s corruption and fall to the Dark Side; as I see it, vision-Malak is clearly an amalgam of the man from multiple periods of time, likely conjured by the Exile’s own broken understanding of events as they transpired after Malachor, and colored by her own internal uncertainties about whether Malak was really evil all along. Precisely because of this, I have elected to change Malak very little; he has a near-perfect mixture of Light and Dark Force abilities already, and only needed the FP to be able to use them more judiciously. He does also get a bit of a bump in difficulty—even as a vision he was a Sith Lord upon a time, after all—and some courtesy feats & stats, but he is mostly left in this curious interstitial state: clearly weaker than he would have been as Dark Lord, yet also clearly much stronger and darker than he was when he actually left for the Wars.

### Explanation

Ah yes, the famous Jedi 1 & 2. How could anyone forget them?

Real talk, it annoys the hell out of me that you walk into the tomb of Ludo Kressh, pop off one Storm, and everybody but Malak is instantly dead. As I envision it, the Jedi surrounding Malak had to be individuals whom the Exile knew—these are her visions, after all. There’s no reason why the more-or-less literal ghosts of her past should be mooks that are so mook-y that they would make a random Onderonian soldier blush. If she cared enough about these people to still be thinking of them ten years later, then they shouldn’t be so utterly simple to dismiss. To that end, the group of four have been split: two are left as guardians (new stats below), and two are moved to Consulars, each with a different stat line and abilities. They’ve also been given attributes equivalent to a level one character, their set has been bumped to let them scale, and they’ve been given some basic courtesy feats. They will likely still die in a single dedicated melee round, but hopefully not to a single shot of Storm, which will—I hope—make them feel a bit more impactful.

## Kreia Encounter

Your exact party is imported ‘as-is’, and do not vanish when taking a single point of damage OR when Kreia is defeated (previously, one of the two always applied).

### Explanation

I really like what Obsidian was trying to do here, forcing the player to make a judgement call on who in their team they really trust and pitting the party against itself before the actual breach in the party at the Restored Enclave occurs. However, the way the fight is set up in the basegame is, uh, stupid. Kreia appears in her guise as Traya right from the beginning, instantly giving away to the player that she really has fallen to the Dark Side and taking all introspection out of the encounter: if you’re LS you will either fight her to stop her or side with her to redeem her, whereas if you’re DS you will either fight her to supplant her or kill your party because you’re a murderous psychopath. There’s no moment of indecision or consideration where the player is forced to actually think about who they trust.

Oh, and speaking of how that fight is stupid, the ghost party all instantly dissipates in a single hit. Huh? Why? Kreia is solid; all the other specters in the tomb (barring the first Jedi with Malak), figures from _ten years ago_, are all solid; why would the people who are closest to you, those that you know right that instant, the most ephemeral of all the specters in the tomb?

There could be some thematic poetry to this, an implication that, despite being the Lost Jedi, your party are meaningless compared to the real mover of events that is Kreia. I don’t even have a problem with this impression, per say. But it leads to a situation where your choice in the encounter does not actually seem to matter, because even if you pick the “hardest” choice and have to fight the entire party, they simply vanish in a single hit, and you are not punished for your choice. There is no hand-wringing struggle of considering whether you can beat your _entire party_ combined against you, they just vanish in puffs of smoke.

Now there is. Your party doesn’t vanish instantly on a single hit any longer, or when Kreia dies (previously they always would vanish when the Kreia-vision was defeated). Now, if you piss off the entire party, you are potentially in very grave danger.

## Vision Exile

Your equipment, feats and stats are copied over ‘as-is.’

### Explanation

Currently, the Exile fight copies most of your stats, but does not copy your class (the vision-Exile is always a Marauder); lightsaber (the vision-Exile is always given a double-bladed saber); your robe; or your alignment (the vision-Exile is always DS). Because of changes made to the Revan vision which will be discussed more below, and for better thematic consistency with your own character, both your equipment and alignment are now copied in addition to your attributes, feats, powers and other equipment.

### Explanation

My biggest bone to pick, as you may be able to tell, is with Revan. No matter your choices when talking with Atton, no matter how you built your original Revan in the first game, the Revan you get is always the same: full DS, two lightsabers, 16 in every attribute. Wow, so personalized.

Obsidian’s programmers (wrongly) determined that it was impossible to import a save from the first game, so I understand the constraints they found themselves placed under. However, they definitely could’ve done better than this milquetoast wonderbread Revan. For instance, in the conversation with Atton determining what alignment Revan should be, they could’ve added some dialogue about whether Revan was a fierce duelist or master of the Force. From there, the Revan that appears in the tomb could match the alignment and—broadly—the combat style of the Revan you described. And oh wow look that’s exactly what we did.

Now, the Revan that appears before your player will be one of four options, based on your choices in a slightly-modified dialogue with Atton: LS/Consular, LS/Guardian, DS/Consular, or DS/Guardian. LS Revans will not use red lightsabers, and also have their DS robes replaced with white Star Forge Robe versions. LS Revans also receive max saving throw bonuses to offset the tomb’s natural -100 saving throw rolls for LS-aligned characters within the tomb, to ensure that the LS versions aren’t pushovers.

The goal here is not to make your exact Revan; this is through a glass darkly, after all. As we’ve discussed before, this is, in some ways, the Exile’s own broken picture of the person she once knew, updated but also confused by the knowledge she’s gained by returning to known space and the things she’s learned from those who knew Revan, like Kreia and Canderous; he isn’t, and shouldn’t be, a perfect cognate. But he at least no longer appears totally one-dimensional, and his representation changes as the Exile’s own understanding of his nature does.
